# Web Development Project 2 - _Flashcards_

Submitted by: **Vanessa Tang**

This web app: **contains flashcard with questions about the Virtual YouTuber, Hoshimachi Suisei. The user can click on the next button to move onto the next question as well as the previous button to go back to a question (the previous button is disabled on the first card). When the user reaches the end of the deck, a restart button appears that restarts everything and shuffles the cards so they will appear in a different randomized order.**
